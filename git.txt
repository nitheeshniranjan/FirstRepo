How to push code from VS Code to GitHub

Note

This guide explains this concept in vanilla Git. For Graphite documentation, see our CLI docs.


Pushing code from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to GitHub involves several steps that ensure your code is safely uploaded to your GitHub repository. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to push code directly from VS Code to GitHub, utilizing both the graphical user interface (GUI) of VS Code and the integrated terminal.

Setting up your GitHub repository
Create a new repository on GitHub:

Visit GitHub and sign in.
Click on the "New" button under the "Repositories" tab.
Enter your repository details and create the repository.
Connect your local repository to your GitHub repository:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to your project directory:
Terminal
cd path/to/your/project


Add the remote repository:
Terminal
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git


Verify the remote repository:
Terminal
git remote -v


How to push code from VS Code to GitHub
Using the VS Code GUI
Open your project in VS Code.
Open the Source Control panel:
Click on the Source Control icon on the sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+G.
Stage your changes:
Click on the '+' icon next to each changed file to stage files individually, or click on the "Stage All Changes" icon at the top to stage all changes.
Commit your changes:
Enter a commit message in the input box at the top of the Source Control panel.
Press Ctrl+Enter to commit the staged files.
Push your changes:
Click on the '...' button at the top of the Source Control panel, then select "Push" from the dropdown menu.
If you are pushing to a new branch, select "Push to" and enter the branch name.
Using the VS Code terminal
Open the integrated terminal in VS Code:
Use the shortcut Ctrl+` (Control + backtick) or navigate through View -> Terminal.
Stage your changes:
Run the command:
Terminal
git add .


Commit your changes:
Run the command:
Terminal
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"


Push your changes:
To push to the main branch, run:
Terminal
git push origin main


To push to another branch, replace main with your branch name.
Additional tips
Check your current branch:
Before pushing, ensure you are on the correct branch using:
Terminal
git branch


Resolve conflicts:
If there are conflicts between your local and remote repositories, VS Code will alert you to resolve them before you can successfully push. For more information see this guide on resolving merge conflicts in Git.
Pull before you push:
It's a good practice to pull the latest changes from your remote repository to your local repository before pushing new changes:
Terminal
git pull origin main


For more information see the official VS Code documentation.
